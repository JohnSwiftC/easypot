# EasyPot

A simple port-scanner / scraper honeypot built with rust!
Outputs all findings and any related data to the terminal. (Log file in the very near future!)

# Build

Ensure that you have Rust installed, then build with `cargo build --release` after cloning.

# Usage

Syntax is simple! Specify ports or port ranges (`4300`, `10000-10032`) in the command line. Works from there.

# First Release and Problems

This project is currently *very* unstable (but usable!). I will fix this + add features in the near future.
